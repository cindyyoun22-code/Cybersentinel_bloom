# Cybersentinel_bloom

A website that displays presentations that our team, **Cybersentinel** uses! 
Created for our goal: providing a safety net for senior citizens and younger kids who struggle daily with technology use, and staying safe. 

Our specific goal would be to provide digital literacy sessions about 2-3 times a month, on weekends. This club's idea was rooted from a girl scout's gold award project, one of our members started, in which we volunteered at a senior home 2 times a week every week during the summer (the workshops were about 1-2 hours long). We hope to expand across multiple senior homes, providing seniors and kids (the most vulnerable age group when it comes to using devices, especially safely) with a better sense of using technology in the DFW area, and provide students with volunteering opportunities!
